Yes, OpenMetadata can run on-premises or in a hybrid setup connecting to both cloud and on-premises sources.

---

## Data Lineage

### What types of lineage are supported?
- **Table-level lineage**: Relationships between tables
- **Column-level lineage**: How columns transform across pipeline
- **Pipeline lineage**: Task dependencies in workflows
- **Dashboard lineage**: Data sources for visualizations

### How is lineage captured?
- **Automatically**: From SQL queries, dbt models, Airflow DAGs
- **Manually**: Via UI or API
- **Via API**: Programmatically add lineage

### Can lineage track transformations?
Yes, OpenMetadata can capture SQL transformations, dbt models, and custom transformation logic.

### How far back can lineage go?
Lineage can trace upstream and downstream multiple hops (configurable depth).

---

## Data Quality

### Does OpenMetadata include data quality testing?
Yes! Built-in data quality framework with:
- Pre-built tests (null checks, uniqueness, range validation)
- Custom SQL tests
- Automated test execution
- Quality dashboards

### Can I integrate with Great Expectations?
Yes, OpenMetadata can integrate with external quality tools like Great Expectations.

### How are quality tests scheduled?
- Via OpenMetadata scheduler
- Via external orchestrators (Airflow)
- On-demand manual execution

### What happens when a test fails?
- Incident is created
- Notifications sent (email, Slack, webhook)
- Visible in quality dashboard
- Can trigger automated actions

---

## Security & Access Control

### What authentication methods are supported?
- Basic authentication (username/password)
- LDAP / Active Directory
- OAuth 2.0 (Google, Okta, Auth0, etc.)
- SAML 2.0 SSO
- Custom OIDC providers

### What is the access control model?
OpenMetadata uses **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** with support for:
- Pre-defined roles (Admin, Data Steward, Data Owner, Data Consumer)
- Custom roles
- Team-based permissions
- Resource-level permissions

### Can I control access at the column level?
Yes, OpenMetadata supports column-level security with masking policies.

### Is data encrypted?
Yes:
- **At rest**: AES-256 encryption for database
- **In transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

### Does OpenMetadata store actual data?
No, only metadata (schemas, statistics, lineage). Actual data remains in source systems.

---

## Search & Discovery

### How does search work?
OpenMetadata uses Elasticsearch for full-text search with:
- Fuzzy matching
- Faceted filtering
- Relevance scoring
- Auto-suggestions

### Can I search across all entities?
Yes, unified search across tables, dashboards, pipelines, topics, ML models, and more.

### How is relevance determined?
Based on multiple factors:
- Text match
- Usage popularity
- User interactions
- Ownership
- Data quality

### Can I save searches?
Not directly, but you can bookmark frequently accessed entities.

---

- Database queries
- Network latency
- Browser cache

**Solutions**:
- Enable Redis caching
- Optimize database indexes
- Scale Elasticsearch
- Clear browser cache
