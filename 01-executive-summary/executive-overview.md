  root((Data Challenges))
    Data Silos
      Fragmented Systems
      Isolated Teams
      Duplicate Data
    Limited Visibility
      Hard to Find Data
      Unknown Data Quality
      Missing Context
    Compliance Risks
      Regulatory Requirements
      Audit Trails
      Data Privacy
    Poor Quality
      Inconsistent Data
      Unreliable Results
